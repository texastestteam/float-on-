# Float On 

Float On is an interactive p5.js project where colorful boxes float and bounce within a responsive canvas. Each box behaves like a floating object in a pond, with smooth, continuous motion and natural collision responses.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The canvas adjusts to the window size, allowing for an adaptable experience.
- **Natural Motion**: Boxes move with a minimum speed to prevent stopping, creating a realistic floating effect.
- **Collision Detection**: Boxes detect collisions with each other and respond with smooth bouncing mechanics, avoiding overlap and sticking.
- **Intuitive Interaction**: Click and drag a box to move it, then release to let it float naturally with its last velocity.
